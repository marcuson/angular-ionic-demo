# Angular Ionic Starter

What is Ionic Framework, excerpt from Ionic v4 introduction web page (check full intro at
https://beta.ionicframework.com/docs/intro):

"Ionic Framework is an open source UI toolkit for building performant, high-quality mobile and
desktop apps using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

Ionic Framework is focused on the frontend user experience, or UI interaction of an app (controls,
interactions, gestures, animations). Itâ€™s easy to learn, and integrates nicely with other libraries
or frameworks, such as Angular, or can be used standalone without a frontend framework using a
simple script include.

Currently, Ionic Framework has official integration with Angular, but support for Vue and React are
in development."

# TODO

Check Ionic Capacitor instead of Cordova

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
